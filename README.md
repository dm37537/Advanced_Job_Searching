One line pitch: the web application helps to find job posting or job candidate easily by providing automatic, compatible matching on required GPA, degree and skills for job seekers or employers. 

Summary of application: 
There are several job search and posting site in works such as Monster, Indeed and CareerBuilder. While these sites work wonders by providing various filters such as location, job title, job type and others, one of the most time consuming step for the job applicant is manually looking at required GPA, degree or skills section of each job-posting to filter out incompatible postings. Additionally, it is very hard for the employer to filter out incompatible job applicant by job requirement as well. As a result, we are proposing a new database for the job search that focuses on the requirement of the job such as GPA, degree and skills. Since, these GPA, degree requirement are often found for the new graduate job, our main end user target will be the student in school who is looking for the first job.

Features: 

Automatically generating possible candidates who meet the GPA, skills, and degree requirement for the job posting. 

Automatically matching possible job posting for the job seeker whose resume information meets the GPA, skills and degree requirements of job posting.

Routine search engine which returns the possible candidate and job posting information depending on the required GPA, skills and degree.
